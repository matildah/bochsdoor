Prototyping a generic x86 backdoor in Bochs

Inspired by Taylor Hornby's article in PoC||GTFO issue 0x03 about a way to
backdoor RDRAND, I came up with (and prototyped in Bochs) a general backdoor
for an x86 CPU that without knowing a 128 bit AES key, cannot be proven to
exist without reverse-engineering the die of the CPU.

In order to have a functioning backdoor we need several things -- we need a
context in which to execute backdoor code, and ways to communicate with the
backdoor code. The first one is easy to solve -- if we are able to create new
hardware on the CPU die, we can add an additional processor on it (let's call
it or its emulation in Bochs the ubervisor) with a bit of memory and have it
be totally independent from any of the code that the x86 CPU executes.

The second part is harder. We need to find out how we can pass data from
user mode x86 code to the ubervisor with the following constraint -- no code
running on the CPU (whether in user mode, kernel mode, or even SMM mode) should
be able to differentiate between if the CPU is backdoored and a case where it
is not. 

DATA EXFILTRATION USING RDRAND COVERT CHANNEL

We first focus on communication from the ubervisor to user mode x86 code.

The obvious choice for a way to sneak data from the ubervisor to user mode x86
code is of course RDRAND -- there is no way besides reverse-engineering the
circuits that implement RDRAND to tell whether the output of RDRAND is acting
as a covert channel. With all other instructions you could run a known-good
reference CPU in lockstep with a possibly-backdoored CPU and compare the
registers/memory after each instruction, but with RDRAND you cannot.

Here's my implementation of an RDRAND covert channel, which I put in the Bochs
function BX_CPU_C::RDRAND_Eq(bxInstruction_c *i)

Bit64u val_64 = 0;
uint8_t ibuf [16];
/* input buffer is organized like this:
   8 bytes -- counter
   6 bytes of padding
   1 byte -- evilstatus
   1 byte -- evilbyte */
uint8_t obuf [16];
AES_KEY keyctx;

AES_set_encrypt_key(BX_CPU_THIS_PTR evil.aes_key, 128, &keyctx);

memcpy(ibuf,             &(BX_CPU_THIS_PTR evil.counter),    8);
memset(ibuf + 8,         0xfe,                               6);
memcpy(ibuf + 8 + 6,     &(BX_CPU_THIS_PTR evil.evilstatus), 1);
memcpy(ibuf + 8 + 6 + 1, &(BX_CPU_THIS_PTR evil.evilbyte),   1);

AES_encrypt(ibuf, obuf, &keyctx);

if (BX_CPU_THIS_PTR evil.out_stat == 0) {   /* output high half */
    memcpy(&val_64, obuf, 8);
    BX_CPU_THIS_PTR evil.out_stat = 1;
} else {                                    /* output lo half */
    memcpy(&val_64, obuf + 8, 8);
    BX_CPU_THIS_PTR evil.out_stat = 0;
    BX_CPU_THIS_PTR evil.counter++;
}

BX_WRITE_64BIT_REG(i->dst(), val_64);

This is of course is AES run in counter mode -- but with a silly and important
twist. If we just generated a keystream by encrypting a counter and XOR'd the
keystream with the data we want to exfiltrate (and used that as RDRAND output),
given just two sequential RDRAND values, we couldn't know the offset within the
keystream that was used (remember, other code that isn't ours may call RDRAND
any number of times). Instead, we use the data we want to exfiltrate as the
nonce in the block (which contains the counter) we encrypt to generate the
keystream. That way, we don't have any synchronization issues but we retain all
the security properties of CTR mode.

Unless the counter overflows (and this can be avoided by incrementing the key
right before the counter overflows), the output of this version of RDRAND
cannot be distinguished from random data unless you know the AES key.

All we need to receive data from this covert channel is the output of two
consecutive RDRAND executions (if the OS preempts us between the two RDRAND
instructions and runs RDRAND (or switches to another task that runs RDRAND),
we need to try executing the two RDRANDs again. However, in testing this has
not happened).

DATA INFILTRATION TO THE UBERVISOR

We now need to find a way for user mode x86 code to communicate data *to* the
ubervisor (and make it impossible to prove that some given x86 code is doing
so). We have two needs -- we need to encrypt all the data we send to the
ubervisor and we also need a way to signal to the ubervisor that we would like
to send it data.

I decided to hook the ADD_EqGqM function, which is called when an ADD operation
on two 64 bit general registers is decoded.

In order to signal to the ubervisor that there is valid encrypted data in the
registers, we put an (encrypted) magic cookie in RAX and RBX and test for it
each time the hooked instruction is decoded. If the magic cookie is found in
RAX/RBX, we extract the (encrypted) data from RCX/RDX.

We encrypt the data with AES in counter mode -- with a different counter than
is used for the RDRAND exfiltration. Again, we have a synchronization issue --
how can we make sure we always know where the ubervisor's counter is? We
resolve this by having the counter increment only when we see a valid magic
cookie (and of course, for each 128-bit chunk of keystream we generate
afterwards). That way, the ubervisor's counter is always known to us,
regardless of how many times the hooked instruction is executed. 

Note that CTR mode is malleable, if this were a production system I would
include a MAC (and store the MAC result in an additional register pair).

Here is the backdoored ADD_GqEqR function:

 BX_INSF_TYPE BX_CPP_AttrRegparmN(1) BX_CPU_C::ADD_GqEqR(bxInstruction_c *i)
{
  Bit64u op1_64, op2_64, sum_64;
  uint8_t error = 1;
  uint8_t data = 0xcc;
  uint8_t keystream [16];
 
   op1_64 = BX_READ_64BIT_REG(i->dst());
   op2_64 = BX_READ_64BIT_REG(i->src());
   sum_64 = op1_64 + op2_64;

  /* Ãœbercall calling convention:

     arguments:
     RCX = ubercall number
     RDX = argument 1 (usually an address)
     RSI = argument 2 (usually a value)

     RDI = return value
     RBP = error indicator (1 iff an error occured)

     RCX = 0xabadbabe00000002 is POKE to a virtual address
        *(uint8_t *) RDX = RSI
     if the page table walk fails, we don't generate any kind of fault or
     exception, we just write 1 to the error indicator field.

     process accesses memory

     RCX = 0xabadbabe00000004 is POKE to a physical address
        *(uint8_t *) RDX = RSI

     (we only read/write 1 byte at a time because anything else could
     involve alignment issues and/or access that cross page boundaries)
