bochsdoor is a prototype of a generic backdoor for the x86, implemented as a
patch to Bochs.

interesting stuff is in:
cpu/cpu.h
cpu/arith64.cc data infiltration / ubervisor calls
cpu/nofail.cc nofail path for page table walk
cpu/rdrand.cc rdrand data exfiltration

look in image/ for user-mode source code for interfacing with the backdoor
